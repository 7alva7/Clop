You can now configure the drop zone to automatically pass the optimised file through an Apple Shortcut when a file is dropped on it.

## Improvements

- Add support for DJI drone video optimisation
- Make adaptive optimisation faster by computing entropy on JPEGs first
- Workaround for a problem with the Finder **Optimise with Clop** extension that can result in missing files
- Add default **Watermark image** Shortcut for automations and presets
