## Features

### Drop zone presets

Do multiple actions in one go by setting up a drop zone preset. You can now configure a drop zone to automatically apply a specific Apple Shortcut when a file is dropped on it.

## Improvements

- Add support for DJI drone video optimisation
- Make adaptive optimisation faster by computing entropy on JPEGs first
- Workaround for a problem with the Finder **Optimise with Clop** extension that can result in missing files
