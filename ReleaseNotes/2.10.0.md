## Improvements

### PDF

- Update Ghostscript v9 to v10.05.1 to replace the old Postscript PDF interpreter and its security issues with the new C-based PDF interpreter
- Replace old JPEG encoder inside Ghostscript with the new Jpegli encoder for even smaller image-heavy PDFs

### JPEG

- Replace all remaining old JPEG encoders with the new Jpegli encoder
- Resizing and cropping should keep more visual quality now because of Jpegli being integrated into `libvips`

### CLI

- Fix double extension when using `.<extension>` in the `--output` argument
