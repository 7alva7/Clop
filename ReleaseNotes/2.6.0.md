## Side-by-side comparison

You can now compare images, videos and PDFs side by side to see the difference between the original and the optimised version.

- right click on the thumbnail and click **Compare**
- or hover the thumbnail and press `Cmd-D`

## Optimised file location

There is now a way to set where the optimised files will be placed:

- **Temporary folder**: they will be placed in the system temp folder that gets cleaned up periodically by the system
- **In-place (replace original)**: the default, moves the original file into Clop's backup folder and replaces it with the optimised file
- **Same folder (as original)**: places the optimised file alongside the original, renaming it based on the configured template
- **Specific folder**: places the optimised file in a specific path anywhere on disk, configured with a template

## Flexible template paths for the `--output` CLI

When using commands like `clop optimise --output <some path>`, the output path now uses the new templating engine.

To understand this better, here are some examples when resizing the PNG files on Desktop using something like:

```css
# the command is being run from ~/Documents/
~/Documents ‚ùØ clop crop --size 1600x900 --output <template> ~/Desktop/screenshots/*.png
```

... where `<template>` can be:

- `resized_to_%z` -> path relative to current dir, places files in `~/Documents/resized_to_1600x900/`
- `~/Pictures/twitter/%f_%z.%e` -> absolute path, files will get paths like `~/Pictures/twitter/shot_1600x900.png`
- `%P/../twitter/` -> path relative to image dir, places files in `~/Desktop/twitter/`


## Features

- Use the new **[Jpegli](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/04/introducing-jpegli-new-jpeg-coding-library.html?hnid=39920644)** perceptive encoder from Google for even smaller JPEG images
- Update `ffmpeg` to version 7.0 for better video encoding
- Allow configuring the location where Clop stores temporary files and backups and when to clean up files
- Allow disabling floating results UI
- The global `Ctrl-Shift-P` hotkey can now toggle between:
    - **Running**: Clop is listening to clipboard and file events
    - **Paused**: Clop is paused for the next clipboard/file event and will resume automatically
    - **Stopped**: All automatic optimisations are stopped until manually resumed by user


## Improvements

- Add `--adaptive-optimisation` and `--no-adaptive-optimisation` options to CLI commands that can act on images
- Speed up PNG optimisation by using `pngquant`'s `--speed 3` option
- Improve EXIF metadata handling when optimising images and videos
- Detect files that are in progress of being created/modified and wait for the operation to settle before optimising

## Fixes

- Fix `--downscale-factor` parsing on `clop optimise` CLI
- Fix automation not triggering shortcuts for videos and PDFs
- Fix: if a previously optimised file was replaced with a new file, an old backup was being used for optimisations instead of the new file
- Fix creation/modification date not being preserved for videos
