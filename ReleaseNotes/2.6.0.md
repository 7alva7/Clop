## Features

- Use the new [Jpegli](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2024/04/introducing-jpegli-new-jpeg-coding-library.html?hnid=39920644) perceptive encoder from Google for even smaller JPEG images
- Update `ffmpeg` to version 7.0
- Allow configuring the location where Clop stores temporary files and backups and when to clean up files

## Improvements

- Add `--adaptive-optimisation` and `--no-adaptive-optimisation` options to CLI commands that can act on images
- Speed up PNG optimisation by using `pngquant`'s `--speed 3` option
- Improve EXIF metadata handling when optimising images and videos
- Detect files that are in progress of being created/modified and wait for the operation to settle before optimising

## Fixes

- Fix `--downscale-factor` parsing on `clop optimise` CLI
- Fix automation not triggering shortcuts for videos and PDFs
- Fix: if a previously optimised file was replaced with a new file, an old backup was being used for optimisations instead of the new file
- Fix creation/modification date not being preserved for videos
