## Notice

The current macOS Sequoia version has capped the settings contents to a width of 600px for some reason.
There seems to be no way to get around this, for now I'll wait and see if the next macOS update will revert the change.

## Improvements

- Add **Show Clop UI in screenshots** setting in the menu

## Fixes

- Ensure folders are left alone when cleaning up workdir
- Fix Settings window not opening
